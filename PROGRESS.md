## Current state of the code (after M4)

- App UI (per DESIGN.md screens 1–2): `MainWindow` (NavigationSplitView),
  `SidebarView` (folder tree with disclosure state persisted, protocol badges, context
  menus incl. Move-to, drag onto folders / "Connections" header, delete confirmations
  that mention Keychain cleanup, "This Mac" stub section), `ConnectionEditorSheet`
  (protocol-adaptive form, password/key/agent auth with Keychain hint, Advanced group,
  live Test Connection via TCP probe), `DetailPlaceholderView` (summary + stubbed Connect).
- `ConnectionManagerModel` (@Observable, main-actor): persists every mutation, mediates
  vault (secrets follow auth-method changes; duplicate copies secrets; delete cleans up,
  including nested profiles when deleting a folder). Test isolation via FERRY_DATA_DIR /
  FERRY_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE env vars.
- FerryCore additions: `parentFolderID(ofItem:)`, `allFolders`, `ReachabilityProbe` (TCP).
- Known scope notes: within-folder index reordering by drag is deferred to M16 (drop-on-
  folder + Move-to menu work now); Test Connection is TCP reachability until M6's real
  protocol handshake; "This Mac" items are non-functional until M5/M7.
- Tests: 40 in FerryKit (all green) + 3 XCUITests (all green, isolated store).

## Earlier state (after M3)

- `FerryCore/Store/CredentialVault`: Keychain wrapper — roles `password`/`keyPassphrase`
  per profile UUID, upsert store, nil-on-absent retrieve, idempotent delete, `deleteAll`
  for profile removal. Login keychain, WhenUnlocked accessibility (ADR-010).
- Tests: 35 total, all green (unit: account-format contract; integration: 8 real-Keychain
  tests with self-cleaning test service).

## Earlier state (after M2)

- `FerryCore/Models`: `ConnectionProfile` (no secrets; port defaults per protocol),
  `TransferProtocol` (sftp/ftp/ftps/scp), `AuthenticationMethod` (password/publicKey/agent),
  `TunnelConfiguration` (schema fixed early for M14), `ProfileFolder` + `SidebarItem`
  (recursive tree, clean JSON discriminator), `ConnectionLibrary` (queries + add/remove/
  update/rename/move with cycle protection).
- `FerryCore/Store/ConnectionStore`: stateless JSON persister — atomic writes, intermediate
  dirs, ISO8601 dates, sortedKeys stability, schemaVersion probe with precise
  newer-version error (ADR-009). Default path: `~/Library/Application Support/Ferry/connections.json`.
- Tests: 24 total (16 unit + 8 integration incl. 6 real-filesystem persistence tests), all green.

## Earlier state (after M1)

- Xcode project `Ferry.xcodeproj` (hand-authored, objectVersion 77) with app target `Ferry` + `FerryUITests`; 4 build configurations (Debug/Release × Direct/AppStore) and 2 shared schemes (`Ferry-Direct`, `Ferry-AppStore`). Builds clean.
- `FerryKit` local SwiftPM package holds all future core logic. Currently: `FerryVersion` placeholder + 1 unit test + 2 integration smoke tests (SSH banner / FTP greeting) — all passing.
- Docker test infra (`testinfra/`): SFTP on 127.0.0.1:2222, FTP on 2121 (`ferry`/`ferrypass`), seeded fixtures; `start.sh`/`stop.sh` verified working.
- App shows a branded placeholder window; approved icon (concept A) generated into the asset catalog by `tools/generate-appicon.swift`.
- All docs written (see CLAUDE.md doc map). Nothing committed yet — first commit happens on M1 approval.

## Known issues / open items

- Bundle id `com.gfragos.Ferry` and ad-hoc signing are placeholders until the user has an Apple Developer account (BUILDING.md).
- Trademark/domain check for the name "Ferry" is the user's task before sale.

## Next steps

1. User reviews M4 (app is runnable — compare against docs/design/ferry-mockups.html) →
   on approval: commit.
2. M5: `FileSystemSource` protocol + `LocalFileSource` with security-scoped bookmark
   handling; unit + filesystem integration tests.

## Session log

- **2026-07-05** — Project inception. Requirements gathered; plan approved (18 milestones). M0: mockups of 5 screens + icon concepts built and iterated (sync browsing added on user request); user approved mockups + icon A. M1: repo initialized, Xcode project + FerryKit package + test targets created, Docker test infra up, icon generated, all docs written. All suites green: 1 unit + 2 integration + 1 UI test (user enabled DevToolsSecurity). M1 approved & committed (97fccf4).
- **2026-07-05 (cont.)** — M2 built: domain models (profile/folder tree/tunnels/auth), ConnectionLibrary operations with cycle-protected move, ConnectionStore JSON persistence (ADR-009). 24 tests green (one test-side fix: stability check had regenerated UUIDs). App builds. M2 approved & committed (18d38e5).
- **2026-07-05 (cont.)** — M3 built: CredentialVault Keychain wrapper (ADR-010: login keychain so `swift test` works unsigned; revisit at M17 for App Store). 35 tests green incl. 8 real-Keychain integration tests. M3 approved & committed (dff4ded).
- **2026-07-05 (cont.)** — M4 built: connection manager UI (sidebar tree, editor sheet, detail summary, folder prompts, drag-to-folder, Move-to menu), ConnectionManagerModel with vault-aware save/delete/duplicate, ReachabilityProbe + hierarchy queries in FerryCore. 40 kit tests + 3 UI tests green. M4 awaiting review.
